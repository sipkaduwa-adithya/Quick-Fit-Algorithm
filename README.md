# Quick-Fit-Algorithm
This Python program simulates the Quick Fit memory allocation algorithm. It allocates processes to the best-fit memory blocks from a predefined set of memory blocks and processes. The program displays the results of the allocation, showing which processes were successfully allocated and the remaining memory block sizes.
